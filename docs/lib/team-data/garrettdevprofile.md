## Enneagram Test

The Enneagram Test scored me as Type 5, 6, and 9.
- I don't think all three are particularly applicable to me since they're quite different, but if I had to pick one I'd say 5 is the most accurate
- Key Motivations: Want to possess knowledge, to understand the environment, to have everything figured out as a way of defending the self from threats from the environment.

## Type9 Test 

The type9 scored me as Type 1.
- Key Motivations: Want to be right, to strive higher and improve everything, to be consistent with their ideals, to justify themselves, to be beyond criticism so as not to be condemned by anyone.
