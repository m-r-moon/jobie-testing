## Enneagram Test

The Enneagramtest scored me as Type 6: The Loyalist.
- The Loyalists are responsible, trustworthy, and value loyalty to family, friends, groups, and causes. Their personalities range broadly from reserved and timid to outspoken and confrontative.
- Some pros of being a loyalist are being committed and faithful to my family and friends.
Being responsible and hardworking, compassionate toward others, and always being direct and assertive.
- Some cons of being a loyalist include the constant push and pull involved in trying to make up my mind, fearing being abandoned or taken advantage of, wishing I had a rule book at work so I could do everything right, and being too critical of myself when I haven't lived up to my own expectations.

## Type9 Test 
The type9 test described me as Type 2: The Helper.
- The Helper is known for being warm, concerned, nurturing, and sensitive to other people's needs.
- Pros of being a Helper include being able to relate easily to people, easily make new friends, being sensitive and perceptive about others' feelings, being enthusiastic, fun-loving, and having a good sense of humor. 
- Some cons associated with being a Helper include not being able to say no, feeling drained from overdoing for others, not doing things I really like to do for myself for fear of being selfish, and working so hard to be tactful and considerate that I suppress my real feelings.
