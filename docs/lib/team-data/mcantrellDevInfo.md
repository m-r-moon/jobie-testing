## Enneagram Reflection

Enneagramtest.net most correctly scored me as Type 6: The Loyalist.

Type9.com most accurately described me as Type 2: The Helper.

These results reflect very accurately about how I work with dev teams at work and 
during school. Loyalists help their team while making sure standards 
are met. Helpers are compassionate toward team problems and equally as hardworking. 

## Two Strengths and Two Weaknesses for each type

**Loyalist**

Strengths

- Confronts problems directly
- Compassionate and helpful to team members

Weaknesses

- Constantly wants things to be by the book and perfect
- Worries and Scans for danger when it isn't there

**Helper**

Strengths

- Being able to easily make friends and work together
- Fun-loving and a sense of humor

Weaknesses

- Struggles with being able to say No
- Caring more for others than yourself
