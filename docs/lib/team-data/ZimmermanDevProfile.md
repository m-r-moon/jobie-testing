# Michael Zimmerman Dev Profile

### Name (team-data.md): Michael Zimmerman
### Major (team-data.md): CIS
### Grad Year (team-data.md): Fall 2020
### GitHub Profile (gitHubLinks.html)(Issue 31): [Profile](https://github.com/mzimmerman0)

## Enneagram Results:
### EnnegramInstitute.com

#### Type 5 (The Investigator)
They are able to concentrate and focus on developing complex ideas and skills. Type 5's are also able to remain calm during highly stressful situations.

### 9types.com
### Type 9 (The Peacemaker)
Type 9's have the ability to be a good mediator and facilitator. They have a way to remove themselves when needed, but show compassion when those times occur. 

I believe these results to be pretty accurate. I personally feel as I reserve and observe most every situation that I am in. This allows to me to be able to handle those complex situations because I have observed all the variables and understand how to get the desired outcome. 

### Strengths:
- For this group, as an Investigator, this shows I can handle some of the more complex issues that arise.
- As a Peacemaker, I can easily get along with anyone and accept any role given to me.

### Weaknesses
- A weakness that occur, as an Investigator, is putting my knowledge out into the world and expressing my ideas.
- As a Peacemaker, I might just go along with something I do not agree with just for sake of keeping peace.
