Enneagram tests:

eneagramtest.net said I was type 5: The Investigator

9types.com said I was type 8: The Challenger

The test results were fairly accurate. They described some of my characteristics but not all parts of the results reflected the way I act towards others. 
The results say I am confident and self reliant with my work, but am still supporting towards other. Although between the two tests I took I would certainly say I am closer to the Challenger.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Investigator: 
Some Strengths for the investigator are the ability to concentrate and focus on complex skills
Some Weaknesses for the investigator are feeling bad when I act defensive(not true)

Challenger:
Some Strengths for the challenger are confidence, strength, and direction
Some Weaknesses for the challenger are being restless and impatient with others' incompetence

Contributions:

My contribution activity says I have made 22 commits in 2 repositories. More specifically I wrote most of the javascript in script.js within iss33 that connects to the team page.
I added my information to the team-data.md on the master branch. I added more html cards to the index.html in iss33 to allow for more team members to be showcased. I also standardized the image names used in the team page.
And I have created 2 branches and 1 issue total.
