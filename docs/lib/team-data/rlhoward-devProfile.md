## Enneagram Reflection

https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test result says I am a Type 1: The Reformer.

https://www.9types.com described me as Type 1 & 8: Reformer( The Perfectionist)/ Leader(The Asserter).

These results were surprisingly accurate of both strengths and weaknesses.
The Rational, Idealistic Type: Principled, Purposeful, Self-Controlled, and Perfectionistic
The Powerful, Dominating Type: Self-Confident, Decisive, Willful, and Confrontational

## Two Strengths and Two Weaknesses for each type

**The Reformer/Perfectionist**

Strengths

- conscientious and ethical, with a strong sense of right and wrong
- wise, discerning, realistic, and noble. Can be morally heroic.
- well-organized, orderly, and fastidious, they try to maintain high standards
- Ones are people of practical action—they wish to be useful in the best sense of the word 

Weaknesses

- can slip into being critical and perfectionistic and typically have problems with resentment and impatience
- always striving to improve things, but afraid of making a mistake
- they are usually seen by others as highly self- controlled, even rigid, although this is not how Ones experience themselves. 

**The Challenger/Asserter**

Strengths

- self-confident, strong, and assertive, protective, resourceful, straight-talking, and decisive
- Eights are charismatic and have the physical and psychological capacities to persuade others to follow them into all kinds of endeavors
- being “in charge” and leaving their imprint on their sphere is uniquely characteristic of them.
- They want to be independent, and resist being indebted to anyone.

Weaknesses

- fear of being disempowered or controlled in some way. 
- afraid of being hurt emotionally and will use their physical strength to protect their feelings and keep others at a safe emotional distance. 
- because they fear that they will be rejected, eights attempt to defend themselves by rejecting others first
