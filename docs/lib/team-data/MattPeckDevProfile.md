## Enneagram Results:
### enneagram.net results say that I am a Loyalist:

Type 6: The Loyalist

Loyalists are responsible, trustworthy, and value loyalty to family, friends, groups, and causes. Their personalities range broadly from reserved and timid to outspoken and confrontative.

### 9types.com results were a Type 2: The Helper

The Helper (the Two)
Helpers are warm, concerned, nurturing, and sensitive to other people's needs.

I believe these results to be accurate.  I feel I am responsible and depend on loyalty of family and co workers.  I also feel as though I am a Helper when it comes to work and look out for other people's feelings. 


### Strengths:
#### The Loyalist:
##### With this group, while working on a project, it shows I would be loyal and trustworthy.  I would be someone that the group could trust and rely on. 
#### The Helper:
##### With this group, if a project gets tough or stressful, I would be a shoulder to lean on and make sure everyone's needs are being met.
### Weaknesses:
#### The Loyalist:
##### A weakness for this in a working group would be putting your trust in someone to a fault.  Depending on others to be loyal and "have your back" and then find out they don't. 
##### The Helper: 
##### A weakness for this group in the working world would be that you get caught up in emotions and let that dictate your results.  Being overly concerned about if this would hurt someone's feelings and not focusing on the task at hand.
