Enneagram Results:

enneagramtest.net said that I was type 6: The Loyalist

9types.com said that I was type 7: The Generalist

The results that the enneagram tests gave me were mostly accurate. I am very loyal and 
I highly value the people that are close to me. I do see myself as trustworthy along with 
being outspoken and confrontative. I do tend to be optimistic, sometimes overly so. These
tests helped me understand more about myself and how I can become better. 

Strenghts and Weaknesses for each type:

The Loyalist:
Strengths: The first strength I have in relation to my enneagram type is being commited and faithful 
to my family and friends. This one is the best strength that I have and I am happy that this test
pointed that out. The second Strength is being responsible and hardworking. 
Weaknesses: My first weakness is the fear of being abandoned or taken advantage of. To help with this
I need to trust people more than I currently do. My second weakness exhausting myself by worrying
and scanning for danger. I agree with this one because I feel like something bad is always going to 
happen before I make a decision.

The Generalist:
Strengths: The first strength I have for this enneagram type is being optimistic and not letting
life's troubles get me down. My second strength is having such varied interests and abilities. I
feel this one is the most true. I have many different interests and abilitites.
Weaknesses: My first weakness is not having enough time to do all of the things I want. This is 
definitely a weakness because I feel that it is important to have time to do the things you enjoy
for your mental health. My second weakness is getting lost in plans or fantasies.
