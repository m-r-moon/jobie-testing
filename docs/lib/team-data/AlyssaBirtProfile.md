### 9types.com said that I was mainly a type 4: The Artist

I believe that these results are quite realistic. I'm really insecure in all aspects and I worry quite a bit about everything. (The Loyalist) I also am a 'romantic' in the sense that I care a lot about people and how they view me or act towards me. (The Artist) These two personality traits actually clash a lot because I don't trust people, but I'm extremely codependent. 

With the strengths and weaknesses listed below, I want to point out how these would relate to a work environment. I'm a hard-worker, but I can have self-doubt and withdraw. I like structure and routine, but if it changes or is unpredictable that might cause an issue for me. I can be empathetic towards others or I can be intense and passive-aggressive. 

### Strengths:
#### The Loyalist:
##### The committed, security-oriented type. Sixes are reliable, hard-working, responsible, and trustworthy. Excellent “troubleshooters,” they foresee problems and foster cooperation. At their best, they are internally stable and self-reliant, courageously championing themselves and others. They inspire others to demonstrate faith and trust in themselves and others.
#### The Artist:
##### They can be compassionate, idealistic, expressive, sensitive to feelings, self-aware, empathetic, and have emotional depth.
### Weaknesses:
#### The Loyalist:
##### Physical: They tend to overvalue structure, order and routine. They may develop fixed (even rigid) habits, becoming finicky and fastidious. As a result, they are likely to work excessively. Also, they may minimize sleeping hours to complete their long task-list.
##### Emotional: They experience negative emotions like self-doubt, suspicion and worry/anxiety. Given their over-cautious and hyper-vigilant nature, they may also be prone to Paranoia or co-dependence. They can display passive-aggressive tendencies.
##### Mental: Views the world as uncertain and risky, even dangerous. So, they find it hard to see and trust the upsides of life. Particularly, they fear being lost, insecure and inferior.
##### Relational: They can get disturbed by change, unpredictability, disorganized systems and lack of structure. Also, they an become defensive, evasive and anxious, constantly complaining and testing others commitment.
#### The Artist:
##### They can be moody, withdrawn, temperamental, prone to melancholy, self-indulgent, intense, self-absorbed, unsatisfied with what is, and uncooperative.
