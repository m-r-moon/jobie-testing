### Strengths:
#### The Individualist:
##### Identity seekers, who feel unique and different, Being different and unique is important to an individualist. In the work place I would probably need space to do my work. But, I am not afraid to ask for help when I am stuck. I also have no problems working with people and can get along with most. 

### Weaknesses:
#### The Individualist:
I can get lost quickly if things move too fast. I am complex and can be sensitive at times. I can seem withdrawn at times but I am probably reflecting on what is happening in the moment.
